<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Preference for Abstract Art According to Thinking Styles
and Personality</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Mark C. Gridley</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Heidelberg University</i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Studies are reviewed that summarize correlations between art
preferences and field dependence, authoritarianism, religiosity, dogmatism,
conservatism, openness to experience, global thinking, sensation seeking,
psychoticism, concrete versus abstract thinking, sequential versus random
thinking, and the ego functions of intuition and sensation. Abstract art is
preferred over representational art among individuals who enjoy novelty,
ambiguity, and dissonance and are particularly sensation seeking, open-minded,
field-independent thinkers, and are particularly low in desire for simple
order. Abstract thinkers and random thinkers are more often fans of abstract
art than are field-dependent, concrete, sequential thinkers. Analogous findings
with food, music, and visual stimuli suggest the existence of cross-modal
relations in aesthetic preferences. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A number of psychologists have not accepted the old adage
that there is no accounting for taste. They have conducted investigations
regarding links between personality, thinking style, and art preferences. The
following discussion summarizes highlights of their work, and it offers new
interpretations and future directions to be pursued, particularly with respect
to preferences for abstract art.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Cross-Cultural Trends in Art Preferences </b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">To begin considering what underlies preferences for abstract
art let us first examine the relative popularity of abstract art. Something you
can go out and see in the real world is the subject of representational art.
The designation "abstract art" ranges from distortions of familiar
figures to entire canvases occupied by drips and color fields. In museum tours,
showing 76 original oil paintings that ran from the 15<sup>th</sup> century
through the 20<sup>th</sup> century, from Giovani Bellini to Pablo Picasso,
Rump and Southgate (1967) found their 139 participants preferred pictures
realistically depicting familiar objects. The City of Toronto (Cameron, 1970)
ran a public opinion poll, asking a representative sample of 500 metropolitan
Toronto residents to view, rank according to preference, and comment on
reproductions of 220 paintings. Finding no relation between any demographics
and art style preferences and no relation between art training and art style
preferences, the investigators found the most abstract paintings (by Piet
Mondrian and Jackson Pollock, for instance) were the least liked and the most
representational paintings (by Auguste Renoir and Andrew Wyeth, for example)
were the most liked. They were particularly rejecting of works that distorted
familiar objects, especially the female body, or that represented religious
subjects nontraditionally. Only 14% of the Toronto sample preferred abstract
art to representational art. No personality questions were asked. Therefore, we
do not know whether individual differences in personality or thinking style
were associated with differences in art preferences. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Complementary to the results of Cameron’s (1970) survey, the
team of Komar and Melamid (1997) found that preference trends are rather
consistent across cultures. Their work represented a massive series of studies
with over 10,000 interviewees, sampled from China, Russia, Turkey, Ukraine,
France, Denmark, America, Finland, Canada, Iceland, and Kenya. They found the
most popular subjects were landscapes, then animals and people. Representative
art was generally preferred over abstract art. The least preferred shapes and
forms were abstract arrangements. The most preferred forms were playful designs
with soft curves, and cheerful content that are relaxing to look at.
Considerable variation in preferences did exist, however. For instance, to say
that the most popular color in a particular country was blue, might mean only
that 18 percent of those surveyed chose blue first, while all other colors
received endorsements of less than 18 percent. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Preference differences between participants in the Toronto
study and between participants in the surveys of Komar and Melamid (1997) lead
us to ask how we might account for the diversity of preferences. Since neither
Cameron nor the team of Komar and Melamid asked any questions regarding
personality or thinking styles we do not know whether individual preferences
corresponded in any way to personality traits or thinking styles.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Dissonance, Psychoticism, and Preferences for Music and
Art </b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Several attempts to specify underlying psychological
processes in visual preferences have been limited by their lack of personality
questions, as in the surveys of Cameron (1970) and Komar and Melamid (1997).
For example, the usefulness of a study by Morriss and Dunlap (1988), addressed
by Martindale (2001), is also limited by the absence of personality and
thinking style measures on the participants. Morriss and Dunlap tested Goethe’s
Law (1810) about how pleasingness may be related to the proportional size of
areas occupied by different colors in paintings according to the lightness of
those colors. This law originated when Goethe first assigned numbers to each
primary color to indicate relative lightness, such that yellow was 9, orange
was 8, red was 6, violet was 3, blue was 4, and green was 6. He contended that
in order to achieve maximum pleasingness the area of a color should be
inversely proportional to the number assigned to it. For example, as yellow is
three times as light as violet, the area of yellow in a painting must be one
third the area of violet to produce the most pleasing combination. In Morriss
and Dunlap’s study various combinations of lightness and saturation were
adjusted by naïve subjects to achieve the greatest pleasingness and test
Goethe’s Law. About half of their subjects obeyed Goethe’s Law. Personality
could be expected to account for some of the difference between Morriss and
Dunlap’s subjects who preferred brightness according to Goethe’s formula and
those who did not. Yet regarding these findings, instead of considering
personal temperament, Martindale speculated that adults tend to disregard
brightness or lightness because it carries little useful information, whereas
brain damaged people and psychotics do attend to it (Martindale, 2001;
Martindale, Boselie &amp; Dailey, 1994). </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In contemplating the reasons for aesthetic preferences and
the findings of Morriss and Dunlap, Martindale (2001) referred to an object
classification task refined by Goldstein and Sheerer (1941) that has been used
to investigate concept formation and is occasionally used to screen for brain
damage. Martindale cited the finding that only psychotic and brain damaged
subjects sort objects on the basis of lightness. Relevant to this observation
is work by Eysenck and Eysenck (1976), who used the term “psychoticism” in
developing the P scale of the <i>Eysenck Personality Questionnaire</i> (EPQ).
In Eysenck’s P scale the scores are not necessarily a measure of insanity, but
some of the traits on it lie along a continuum with traits possessed by both
normals and psychotics. Regarding Martindale's remark that only psychotic and
brain damaged subjects sort objects on the basis of lightness it is interesting
that he did not address the facts that (1) normal individuals lie on a
continuum with psychotics in their scores on the P scale or that&nbsp; (2) high
scorers on the tough-mindedness factor of this scale, who were neither
psychotic nor brain damaged, have been found to prefer (a) complex drawings
(Eysenck, 1994), (b) jazz (Lester &amp; Whipple, 1996), (c) graphically violent
horror movies (Weaver, 1991), (d) enhanced bass in music (McCown, et al, 1997),
and (e) dissonant chords in music (Rawlings, et al, 1995), or that Eysenck
(1994) himself reported that these people tend to like (f) unusual things.
These other findings suggest that personality could be expected to account for
some of the difference between Morriss and Dunlap’s subjects who preferred
brightness according to Goethe’s formula and those who did not. This should not
be a surprise if we recall that food preferences are also linked to personality
and temperament (Child, Cooperman &amp; Wolowitz, 1969), and music preferences
also have been shown to correlate with personality traits (Cattell &amp;
Saunders, 1954; Dollinger, 1993; Glasgow, Cartier &amp; Wilson, 1985; Livosky,
et al, 2012; McCowan, et al, 1997; Payne, 1967; Rawlings, et al, 1995; Rentfrow
&amp; Gosling, 2003). For instance, individuals who prefer whole cranberries
more than cranberry jelly, cookies more than cake, bitter sweet chocolate more
than sweet chocolate, dark bread more than light bread, hard rolls more than
soft rolls, and sour pickles more than sweet pickles also tend to be more
independent and prefer more intellectual challenge than individuals who do not
have these preferences. By comparison with introverts, extraverts tend to
prefer more active, unusual music, with high arousal properties, and listeners
scoring high on agreeableness in measures of the Big Five personality traits
tend to like pop music and “easy listening” music more than listeners who score
low on agreeableness. Individuals scoring high on conservatism tend to prefer
familiar music. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As preference for simple order and lack of intensity
distinguish trends in preferences for stimuli in all three sense modalities
(vision, audition and taste) why would there not also be similar relations
between personality and preferences for degrees of regularity in visual forms?
In fact, other studies and comments by Martindale about the origins of
aesthetic interests addressed similar cognitive processes. For example,
Martindale contended that jarring, rough sounding harmonies, known in music as
dissonances, are displeasing (Martindale, 2001). Yet some music listeners like
dissonance (Lester &amp; Whipple, 1996; Pabon &amp; Gridley, 1998). For
example, among listeners who are attracted to dissonance are aficionados of
avant-garde music throughout the twentieth century, and not just fans of Bela
Bartok, Arnold Shoenberg, Alban Berg, Krystof Penderecki, Karlheinz
Stockhausen, and Olivier Messiaen. I have found dissonance lovers among jazz
fans who are partial to the playing of Thelonious Monk, Cecil Taylor, Anthony
Braxton, and some late-period John Coltrane. These findings with food, music,
and visual stimuli suggest the existence of cross-modal relations in aesthetic
preferences. The irregular, jarring combinations of pitches that constitute
dissonance in music may be analogous to irregular patterns in visual stimuli,
as in paintings by Wassily Kandinsky, Willem Dekooning, and Jackson Pollock.
This is relevant because of Martindale’s discussion of results in studies of
visual preferences by Martindale, Boselie, and Dailey (1994). Finding
preference for bands of wavelength symmetries to be a function of the
simplicity of their spectra, the investigators observed that people are
displeased by bands in which the elements are not repeated in exactly a
straight line, in which the elements are not equally spaced, or in which
different forms rather than the same form are repeated. Martindale described
the spectra of such bands as horrible messes and mentioned that such bands are
almost never used in decorative art (2001). Yet Martindale did not mention that
this finding might help explain why many viewers also consider the great
abstract artworks to be horrible messes (Cameron, 1970) and why bebop jazz is
so much less popular than swing style jazz (Gridley, 1984). The characteristics
of disliked bands of wavelengths could just as easily describe bebop jazz. For
example, the direction of improvised lines contains elements that are not
repeated in exactly a straight line, and the kernels of melody within
improvisations are not equally spaced. Bebop jazz is characterized by different
forms of melody, harmony and rhythm, instead of repetitions for the same form.
Despite displeasing many people, perhaps it is precisely such asymmetry in art
and music that pleases a given personality type (Eysenck, 1994; Eysenck &amp;
Furnham, 1993). Though some bebop jazz is not particularly dissonant, bebop
styles have never been as popular as swing styles, and bebop styles are
generally less consonant than swing styles. In conclusion, there is a particular
personality type who is inclined to search for novel sounds and who finds
pleasure in dissonance (Rawlings, et al, 1995). Several traits for this
personality type are identified below in discussions for contributions by
Eysenck and Zuckerman. In other words, personality may play a significant role
in accounting for aesthetic preferences.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Field Dependence</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Martindale’s contentions regarding band width preferences
may also be related to field dependence, and it follows that a portion of art
preferences may be related to the ability to visually extract a hidden figure
from its background. This is disembedding ability, also known as field
independence (Witkin, et al, 1954). This ability differs from person to person
(Witkin, 1950), increases slightly with practice (Goldstein &amp; Chance,
1965), and has a genetic component (Stuart, et al., 1965). Though an ability that
is correlated with intelligence (Goldstein &amp; Blackman, 1978; McKenna,
1984), it is often classified as a cognitive style. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Though research on the relation between disembedding ability
and art preference is scanty, a few studies address the issue. Tobacyck, Myers,
and Bailey (1981) contended that with field independence the person’s
perceptual/cognitive operations appear more analytic, and the person can impose
structure upon stimuli that have little inherent structure. They found that
people with more field dependence showed greater dislike for the
abstract-expressionist paintings of Jackson Pollock, certainly a nonrepresentational
painter, and greater liking for highly structured, representational portraits
by Manet and frontier cabin scenes by Harnett and Haberle. Roubertoux, Carlier,
and Chaguiboff (1971) had made similar observations. Savarese and Miller (1979)
found that individuals indicating field independence, by obtaining scores above
the median on the <i>Group Embedded Figures Test</i> of Oltman, Raskin, and
Witkin (1971), tended to prefer art which emphasizes masses, drawing attention
away from the edges, in which individual elements are no longer separate from
each other, flowing instead into each other and their surroundings. Viewers who
do well at disengaging a smaller part from its whole (i.e., field-independent
individuals) may find the structure of linear art work redundant or simply may
not have as great a need for particularly obvious structure. Such individuals
are able to tolerate the ambiguity that accompanies indistinct outlines and
interior forms. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Individuals who obtained scores lower than the median in
their disembedding ability preferred art that was more linear, such that it
emphasized parts with clear boundaries separating them. The investigators
speculated that viewers who have difficulty finding the parts in the whole
(i.e., field-dependent individuals) feel more comfortable with the imposed
structure of linear art work. The clear outlines and boundary definitions of
linear art work in a sense do the perceptual work for these individuals. This suggests
that the thinking styles of such individuals may also be described by the terms
"concrete" and "sequential," as will be discussed below in
relation to Gregorc's (1982) conceptualization. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Personality</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Having considered relations between psychoticism, field
dependence, and preferences for dissonance and abstract art, we shall next
consider personality traits that are correlated with attractions to art. For
example, using the <i>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</i> and <i>Allport-Vernon
Study of Values</i>, Knapp and colleagues found preference for
nonrepresentational painting to correspond with personalities who are
subjective, imaginative, unpractical, and sensitive (Knapp, 1964; Knapp &amp;
Green, 1960; Knapp &amp; Wulff, 1963). Knapp termed this “the subjective
personality.” This describes the personality type obtained by profiles on the <i>Myers-Briggs
Type Indicator</i> that are designated NFP (Myers, 1980). This is a personality
who is interested in ideas and concepts more than facts and sensations, is an
independent thinker, looks inside the self for inspiration, is interested in
how things are related to each other, the future, abstraction, the subjective,
remains open-minded and curious, and appreciates going on tangents and being spontaneous.
This type of personality is similar to the type identified by a number of
personality researchers who refer to the openness to experience factor (McRae
&amp; Costa, 1977; Rawlings, et al, 1998) and the abstract-random thinking
style (Gregorc, 1982). While other investigators have not used Knapp's
designation, there is evidence for a relatively stable personality type
involving these features. For example, Dollinger (1993) and Rawlings,
Barrante-Vidal, and Furnham (2000) found that openness to experience is
positively related to enjoyment of a variety of different kinds of music,
particularly those that are less conventional<i> </i>or mainstream.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Tough-Mindedness</i>. Another fruitful line of inquiry
involves a subscale of a widely used personality test. Individuals with
elevations on the P scale of the EPQ (Eysenck, 1975) have been shown to have
certain aesthetic preferences. They have also been shown to emphasize (a)
self-reliance, (b) rejection of people, (c) egocentricity, (d) sensation
seeking, and (e) impaired empathy. These traits are associated with high
elevations on the tough-mindedness factor of the P scale. Pyron (1966) found
preference for complexity of perceptual organization to correspond with the
self-reliance and rejection of people, which are also indicated by the
tough-mindedness factor on the P scale (Eysenck, 1975; Zuckerman, Kuhlman &amp;
Camac, 1988). Rawlings, et al (1998) found a substantial relationship between
sensation-seeking, openness, and psychoticism, and a creativity/preference set
particularly represented by preference for complexity. Eysenck (1994) also
found scores on the P scale to be correlated positively with preference for
complexity, and he found them to be correlated with preference for abstract
art. This is consistent with findings of other studies showing that artists
prefer complexity and asymmetry and that high P scores characterize the more
creative artists (Eysenck &amp; Furnham, 1993; Goetz, et al, 1979). Note that,
despite this review's focus on relations between preferences and abstractness
in art, studies relating preferences and stimulus complexity are also cited.
Though they are not equivalent, perceived stimulus abstractness and perceived
stimulus complexity can be influenced by some of the same features of art, and
attractions to both of them frequently occur in the same groups of people. An
examination of interrelatedness and distinctions between these two properties
is beyond the scope of the present review.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Religiosity, Dogmatism, Conservatism, and
Authoritarianism: Desire for Simple Order</i>. Interest in art as a whole may
be related to personality (Gridley, 2004), and preference for abstract art may
exist in a subset of individuals who have a personality that enjoys art. A
trend for that subset seems to be manifested by absence of a pronounced desire
for simple order. The personality traits of religiosity, dogmatism,
authoritarianism, and conservatism may all reflect a desire for simple order,
and the lack of simple order in abstract art may explain its rejection by
individuals who are high in those traits. For instance, dogmatic people,
uncomfortable in a field that does not yield to judgment according to rules,
should place a lower value on any art works than would the more open minded
viewers (Fairhill &amp; Punch, 1991). Several studies have found liking for
art, especially abstract styles, inversely related to religiosity, dogmatism,
and authoritarianism (Frumkin, 1962; Knapp &amp; Wulff, 1963; Rosenberg &amp;
Zimet, 1957). Wilson, Ausman, and Mathews (1973) found conservatism to be
inversely related to preference for complexity in paintings, and the
investigative teams of Roubertoux, Carlier, and Chaguiboff (1971) and Furnham
and Walker (2001a) both found conservatism inversely related to preference for
abstract art. Similarly, Chamorro-Premuzic, et al (2009) found
conscientiousness inversely related to preference for abstract art. Linderman
(1962) found that authoritarian rigidity in judges of art corresponded to a dislike
for abstract works. Consistent with these trends, Pyron (1966) and Rittelmeyer
(1969) found acceptance of avant-garde art (as well as music and literature) to
be inversely related to dogmatism and positively related to acceptance of
change. It should be no surprise that liking for abstract art would be found to
be positively correlated with three other personality traits which are opposite
of the desire for simple order: openness to experience, desire for complexity,
and tolerance for ambiguity. Acceptance of perceptual complexity and tolerance
for perceptual ambiguity relate to other avant-garde aesthetic interests as a
whole, not just art preferences (Raychaudhuri, 1965). Openness to experience
has been found to be associated with liking abstract art (Chamorro, et al,
2009; Rawlings, 2003; Rawlings, Vidal &amp; Furnham, 2000). Note that, though
tolerance for ambiguity is related to openness and correlated with liking
abstract art, mere <i>tolerance</i> for ambiguity might not be the key. <i>Attraction</i>
to ambiguity might explain some preferences for abstract art. This possibility
is explored further below.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i>Sensation Seeking</i>. Attraction to ambiguity and
attraction to perceptual complexity may also be consistent with desire for high
levels of sensation. Therefore, it would be consistent with the fact that
sensation seeking has been found to be positively correlated with preference
for complexity in pictures (Looft &amp; Baranowski, 1971; Rawlings, et al,
1998; Zuckerman, Neary &amp; Brustman, 1970) and that liking for
abstract-expressionist art has been found to be positively correlated with
sensation seeking (Furnham &amp; Bunyan, 1988; Furnham &amp; Walker, 2001a;
Mastandrea, Bartoli &amp; Bove, 2009; Rawlings, 2003; Rawlings, Vidal &amp;
Furnham, 2000; Tobacyck, Myers, &amp; Bailey, 1981).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Concrete and Abstract Thinking Styles</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Now let us turn to what may be the most promising area of
research in the psychology of art preferences: thinking style. In dealing with
different personality dimensions, Gregorc (1982) proposed an approach to
various aspects of personality that derive from perceptual abilities, as
abstract or concrete, and direction of thought, as linear or random. Most
helpful to our purposes are Gregorc's observations of relations between
perceptual abilities, direction of thought, and the presence of aesthetic interests
in general, as well as a proposal for dynamics underlying response to
particular styles of art. Research by Gridley (2006b) has confirmed the utility
of Gregorc's conception for distinguishing art connoisseurs who prefer abstract
art from those who prefer representational art. The more random and abstract
the connoisseurs' thinking scores on the Gregorc Style Delineator, the more
abstract and avant-garde were the connoisseurs' preferred styles of art. Like
art preferences, musical preferences also may be related to listeners’ thinking
styles. For example, when personal indications of liking were plotted against
stimulus complexity in jazz piano recordings Gordon and Gridley (2013) found
musical preferences to be related to musical complexity according to an
inverted-U function. They then suggested that individual listeners may be
distinguished by their inverted-U’s positions on the complexity axis according
to their personal thinking style’s degree of abstractness.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Let us examine Gregorc's conceptualization of thinking
styles in more depth, ultimately leading to a plausible explanation for links
between such styles and art preferences. Gregorc designated perceptual
abilities as the means for grasping information. He identified two qualities of
perceptual abilities. The first is abstractness, which enables the person to
grasp, conceive, and visualize data through the faculty of reason and to
emotionally and intuitively register and deal with inner and subjective thoughts,
ideas, and concepts. This quality permits the person to apprehend and perceive
that which is invisible and formless to the physical senses. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Gregorc designated the second quality of perceptual ability
as concreteness. This enables the person to grasp and mentally register data
through the direct use and application of the physical senses. Some individuals
are more concretely oriented than they are abstractly oriented, and abstract
thinkers are better at synthesizing and integrating many details than concrete
thinkers are because abstract thinkers seek patterns, such as the big picture
(Gregorc, 1982).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In classifying direction of thought, Gregorc designated
ordering abilities as the ways in which we authoritatively arrange,
systematize, reference, and dispose of information. These emerge as two
qualities, (1) sequence, which disposes the mind to grasp and organize
information in a linear, step-by-step, methodical, predetermined order and (2)
randomness, which disposes the mind to grasp and organize information in a
nonlinear, galloping, leaping, and multifarious manner. This style allows data
to be processed simultaneously and holistically. Some individuals are more
sequentially oriented than random, and some are more randomly oriented than
sequential. The coupling of these qualities forms four distinct transaction
ability channels: concrete-sequential, abstract-sequential, abstract-random,
and concrete-random.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Gregorc has found that individuals whose direction of
thought is usually spiraling or tangential, instead of straight-line
(abstract-random and concrete-random thinkers) act as though they have the
ability to perceive things beyond what is in front of them, as a meta-message.
Random thinkers can synthesize more readily than sequential thinkers because
their thoughts and perceptions are jumping around in directions that are
web-like, rather than following a straight line. This resembles a thinking
style that Sternberg (Sternberg &amp; Grigorenko, 1997; Sternberg &amp; Wagner,
1989) termed global, rather than local. Roubertoux, Carlier and Chaguiboff
(1971) had also offered a similar conception.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Gregorc has observed that such thinking style tendencies
correlate with a person's interests. Since, for the concrete-sequential
thinkers “What you see is what you get,” Gregorc has found that
concrete-sequential thinkers often reject the arts because arts have no
practical value. The metaphorical, for instance, may raise fear for the
concrete-sequential thinkers because they do not tend to think in terms of the
abstract relationships conveyed by metaphors.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Much of Gregorc's conceptualizing echoes the thinking of
Goldstein and Scheerer (1941), whose definition of the concrete
ability-attitude (termed “thinking style” in the present paper) mentions that
it is never mediated by discursive reasoning, and that it is immediate, sensory
and tangible. Goldstein and Scheerer contend that the most concrete way of
dealing with situations or things is to react to one aspect of them
exclusively, one color, one dimension, one property, one practical use. This
resembles the “sensation” function described by Jung (1921) that can be
measured by the <i>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</i>’s S scale (Meyers, 1980).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By comparison with the concrete attitude the abstract
ability-attitude embraces more than merely the real stimulus, involves
reasoning, awareness and self-accounting of one’s doing (Goldstein &amp;
Scheerer, 1941). It requires that we transcend the immediate situation, and to
abstract common properties from particular properties. With this
ability-attitude we are oriented by conceptual viewpoints such as category and
class. The abstract ability-attitude is involved when we shift reflectively
from one aspect to another, hold in mind simultaneously various aspects, grasp
the essential of a given whole, abstract common properties reflectively to form
hierarchic concepts, assume an attitude toward the mere possible, and think or
perform symbolically. This resembles the “intuition” function described by Jung
(1921), which can be measured by the <i>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</i>’s N
scale (1980), and which Gridley (2004) found to predominate among a sample of
serious art collectors&nbsp;&nbsp; and a sample of professional fine artists (2006a). </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Age, experience, and gender have not been found to make much
difference in thinking styles. Our preferred styles remain with us for life,
just as our handedness remains for life, though we may increase or decrease in
the flexibility with which we can rotate thinking styles according to
situational demands, as when we employ one style for brainstorming and another
for coming to a decision. Substantial gender differences have not been found in
thinking styles, at least among the 128 artists and 161 engineers in a study by
Gridley (2007),&nbsp; several normative samples for the test of <i>Mental Self
Government Thinking Styles</i> of Sternberg and Wagner (1992), and 400 subjects
in the normative sample for the <i>Gregorc Style Delineator</i> (1982).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The findings of Gregorc, the conceptualizations of Jung,
Goldstein and Scheerer, and the data collected using the <i>Mind Style
Delineator</i> of Gregorc and the <i>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</i> complement
findings on sensation seeking, religiosity, authoritarianism, and psychoticism
(Eysenck's P scale). All contribute to our quest for identifying relations
between thinking styles and art preferences. They demonstrate that some of the
diversity in personal preferences for art styles is related to diversity in
thinking styles. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Considering the conceptualizations of Jung, Gregorc,
Goldstein and Scheerer, it is no coincidence that Machotka (1970) has argued
that aesthetic perception requires an ability to break with mental schemata so
as to approach the world afresh. He suggested that, rather than being good at
disembedding hidden figures (recognizing familiar forms), the individual who
excels at aesthetic perception is good at making sense out of chaos,
synthesizing the whole visual array presented by an art work. Machotka’s own work
has found this tendency to correlate with aesthetic judgment (Machotka &amp;
Waite, 1968). Child (1965) has also reported findings that are similar to
Machotka's. Gregorc (1982) has described this ability as the abstract-random
style. The thinking process of a person with this style jumps around a lot,
taking in a diversity of points, integrating and rapidly getting beyond the
details to obtain a sense of the overall quality of a work.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In keeping with these conceptualizations, Gregorc proposed
that it is reasonable to expect that individuals with the concrete-sequential
type of thinking would be bewildered by the value of abstract expressionist
art, even though they might accept it as art because they see it in a museum
(A. Gregorc, 2001, personal communication). Perhaps greater tension is evoked
by abstract-expressionist art’s novel stimuli and many possible meanings for
the concrete-sequential thinker than for the abstract-random thinker. This
could be expected just as we can expect ambiguity to be disturbing for
individuals with high authoritarianism and high dogmatism. Similar reasoning
also had been offered by Roubertoux, Carlier, and Chaguiboff (1971). We know
that concrete-sequential thinkers tend to dislike abstract paintings and other
avant-garde art forms, and we suspect that this may be due in part to the
strain that such works may place on these viewers’ high desire for simple
order. Note, however, that same strain could be stimulating in a desirable way
for individuals who are high in novelty-seeking and sensation seeking.
Therefore, there could be concrete-sequential thinkers who are sensation
seekers who like abstract art for the sensation that its novel shapes and
colors present. Additionally, some viewers with the abstract-random style of
thinking could be expected to enjoy abstract-expressionist art because it
provides opportunities to organize otherwise disorganized stimuli, and
individuals with this type of thinking style enjoy the challenge of exercising
their organizing capacity. However, for viewers who enjoy ambiguity just for
the sake of ambiguity as for its sensational effect, a satisfaction found in
organizing otherwise disorganized stimuli may not always be relevant in
accounting for attraction to abstract expressionist art. Consistent with this
line of reasoning, Roubertoux, Carlier and Chaguiboff (1971) showed global
thinking style to be associated with preference for abstract art<i>,</i> and
Linderman (1962) found rigid personalities to be less inclined to prefer
abstract art, even with considerable training in art. Moreover, in a sample of
serious art collectors, Gridley (2006b) found that the more sequential and
concrete thinking the art connoisseurs' scores on the <i>Gregorc Style
Delineator</i>, the more realistic and representational were the connoisseurs'
preferred styles of art. The more random and abstract thinking the
connoisseurs' scores on the <i>Gregorc Style Delineator</i>, the more abstract
and avant-garde were the connoisseurs' preferred styles of art. In fact,
Billota and Lindauer (1980) contended that responsiveness to the arts may
depend less on special background and more on cognitive processes related to
aesthetics, physiognomy, and imagination.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The old adage “There is no accounting for taste” is not
true. Differences between attraction to representational art and attraction to
abstract art tend to reflect differences in personality traits and preferred
thinking styles just as food preferences are related to personality and
temperament, and music preferences correlate with personality traits. Abstract
art is preferred over representational art among individuals who enjoy novelty,
ambiguity, and dissonance and who are particularly sensation seeking and
open-minded. Among those who like art, field-independent thinkers, as well as
abstract and random thinkers, are more likely to be fans of abstract art than
are field-dependent, concrete, and sequential thinkers.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Some of the diversity in personal preferences for art styles
is related to diversity in thinking styles. Findings using the
conceptualizations of Gregorc, Jung, and Goldstein and Scheerer demonstrate
that trends linking art preferences to thinking styles complement findings
linking art preferences to such personality dimensions as sensation seeking,
religiosity, conservatism, openness, authoritarianism, and psychoticism. A
common trend that emerged across earlier studies is that low desire for simple
order characterizes individuals who like abstract art. Moreover, mere <i>tolerance</i>
for ambiguity might not be the key. <i>Attraction</i> to ambiguity, due to
thinking style such as the abstract-random style, might partly explain
attraction to abstract art. Viewers with the abstract-random style of thinking
may enjoy abstract-expressionist art in part because the process of
apprehending such creations provides opportunities to organize otherwise
disorganized stimuli, and individuals with this type of thinking style may
enjoy the challenge of exercising their organizing capacity. This viewer
dynamic could be explored by way of research designs that are proposed below.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Future Investigations</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Several future investigations could enhance our
understanding of the links between art preferences and thinking styles. For
instance, one direction could focus on relating the degree to which given art
objects are deemed to be abstract with the degree to which viewers have the
personality and thinking styles that have been linked to preferences for
abstract art. The strength of correlations could be indicated by studies in
which investigators begin by (a) selecting a large sample of paintings, (b)
having experts rank them according to abstractness, then (c) showing them to a
large sample of viewers who are asked to indicate their degrees of liking. (d)
All viewers would be required to complete measures for each of the personality
traits and thinking styles that were identified above. Greater support could be
obtained for the above conclusions by (e) correlating the (1) resulting
preference scores with (2) degrees of abstractness for the viewed paintings and
(3) elevations on the test profiles for personality traits and thinking styles
of the viewers. As the Gridley (2006b) studies on abstract and concrete
thinking styles were done only on high-end art collectors, and many of the
other studies were done only on laymen, the results of future studies would be
most useful if data were collected separately on high-end art collectors and
laymen. Measures of additional thinking styles, such as the holist versus
serialist distinction (Pask, 1972; Pask &amp; Scott, 1972) could supplement the
<i>Gregorc Style Delineator</i>’s measure of abstract versus concrete thinking.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The motive of attraction to ambiguity (instead of mere
tolerance of ambiguity) might be further explored for what might prove to be
sub-motives: (a) enjoyment of challenges to order the chaos, perhaps related to
Need for Cognition (Cacioppo, et al, 1996), and (b) enjoyment of lack of order,
as for stimulation in and of itself, perhaps related to Sensation Seeking
(Zuckerman, Neary &amp; Brustman, 1970), (c) Change Seeking (Garlington &amp;
Shimota, 1964), and (d) Novelty Seeking (Pearson, 1970, 1971). These might identify
different facets of personality that are relevant, thereby indicating
attractions to abstract art that may derive from unrelated aspects of the
viewing tendencies.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Another group of studies could investigate distinctions
between those individuals preferring abstract art in which the subject is still
discernible, as in Picasso's cubist works, and those individuals preferring
abstract art in which nothing familiar reveals itself at all, as in Pollock's
drip paintings. Research could explore differences in preferred thinking styles
of the fans for each category, and it could answer, for example, the question
of who likes wild arrangements of colors and shapes for their own sake, as in
works by Sam Francis and Hans Hoffman, by comparison with who likes puzzle-type
abstract art, as in cubist works by Picasso and collages by Rauschenberg.
Further measures could help determine whether the Need for Cognition (Cacioppo,
et al, 1996) may be a relevant variable in distinguishing the two groups of
fans. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Exploring precisely how viewers experience abstract art
would enhance our understanding of the relationship between thinking style and
art preferences. Such an investigation may be facilitated by accompanying
individuals to art museums and standing with them for approximately 30 minutes
in front of a work by Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, or Wassily Kandinsky,
and interrupting their gaze every few minutes to ask exactly what they are
thinking and seeing. This might be accomplished by means of the think-aloud
technique, as used by Pennebaker’s Electronically Activated Recorders (EARs).
The EAR technique captures 30 seconds of self-reported thoughts every so often,
and it could be used to eavesdrop on the viewers’ thoughts (Mehl, et al, 2001).
Note, however, that to minimize bias, such investigators would need to be
certain that any recording be done by a researcher who is blind to any
experimental hypotheses.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Obtaining profiles from participants in the think-aloud
studies on an assortment of thinking styles measures would allow researchers to
look for trends between the ways abstract art fans process the viewing
experience and their personalities and thinking style. Care must be taken to
ensure that the participants are abstract art fans, not viewers who say,
"How could a museum pay for such crap?," or "My kid could do
that!"</p>
